I read 30 books last year. The number of books I read this year went down
significantly compared to the previous year (I read 42 books in 2013)
because I stopped doing the train commute and there is less time to read.

Anyway my goal for 2014 was to read 30 books and finished the last book on
new year's eve. My goal for 2015 is 30 books. We will see how it goes.
