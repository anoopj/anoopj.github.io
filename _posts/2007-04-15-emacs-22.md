I just now installed Emacs 22 in my new laptop. There are many [new cool features][1] I am excited about.

Emacs 22 is still under development, so I expected a few stability issues. But I&#8217;ve been running it continuously over the weekend with a few dozen buffers and so far it has not crashed on me.

I&#8217;m yet to try my 2000 line-long .emacs (and a ton of elisp libraries it is dependent on) on Emacs 22. Hope all goes well.
