A new version of [gbookmark2delicious][1] is out. All the credit goes to [Yang Zhang][2] who implemented the new features. Some of them include:

*   Incremental synchronization capability for continuous mirroring of Google Bookmarks onto delicious.
*   Updates to work with current Google Bookmarks and delicious interfaces/formats.
*   Handle throttling and persistent retries for delicious&#8217; REST API.
*   More flexibility via beefed-up CLI frontend (more options, etc.)
*   Local cache of the remotely pulled data.
