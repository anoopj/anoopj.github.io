Last month I accepted an offer from <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/" title="Yahoo!" target="_blank">Yahoo!</a> and moved to the Silicon Valley. I had been living in Atlanta for the last 3 years and had made quite a few good friends there. So leaving was harder than I thought it would be, but I was really excited about the new job. This was an opportunity to join a company which is synonymous with the web and work with some really smart people.

Anyway it has been almost a month since I started with Yahoo! and it has been a very interesting experience so far. I&#8217;ve never seen a company which runs completely on open-source software. Most of the development work here happens in C++, Perl and PHP on Linux and FreeBSD. Yahoo! contributes back to the community heavily and employs quite a few open-source hackers. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf" title="Rasmus Lerdorf" target="_blank">Rasmus Lerdorf</a> from PHP, <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/bio.html" title="Jeremy Zawodny" target="_blank">Jeremy Zawodny</a> from MySQL, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Cutting" title="Doug Cutting" target="_blank">Doug Cutting</a> from Lucene/Nutch/Hadoop, just to name a few.)

I was doing Java development before, so was used to doing coding in Windows using Eclipse. So initially I thought of doing development in my Windows laptop using some IDE, but later decided to do my work in Linux using Emacs. The project I work on is deployed in FreeBSD, so I do development in Linux and deploy it in a FreeBSD virtual machine hosted in my Linux workstation using vmware. It&#8217;s a pretty cool set up and I&#8217;ve become a big fan of virtualization at the OS level.

I&#8217;m trying to familiarize myself with the code base and understand the architecture of the whole system. It&#8217;s complex and the scale of deployment is challenging. I believe in learning things by doing hands-on work, so I&#8217;m working on a bunch of new features. The work environment is casual and the people here are very easy-going and helpful. I&#8217;m having a lot of fun.
