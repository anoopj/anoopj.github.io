<script type="text/javascript"></script><p>I recently bought a bike and started riding it to work. Usually it takes me around 15 minutes to drive to work and it takes just 20 minutes to ride the bike to work.  I guess biking to work is a convenient way to get in shape without spending too much time.</p>
