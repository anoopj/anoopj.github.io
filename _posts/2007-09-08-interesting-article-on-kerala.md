My friend <a href="http://jestobservelife.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Anup</a> sent me <a href="http://www.ashanet.org/library/articles/kerala.199803.html" target="_blank" title="Interesting Article on Kerala">this link</a>. It&#8217;s an interesting case study on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala" target="_blank">Kerala</a>, the state in India where I was fortunate to be born and brought up.

An excerpt:

> Kerala does not tell us precisely how to remake the world. But it does shake up our sense of what&#8217;s obvious, and it offers a pair of messages to the First World. One is that sharing works. Redistribution has made Kerala a decent place to live, even without much economic growth. The second and even more important lesson is that some of our fears about simpler living are unjustified. It is not a choice between suburban America and dying at 35, between agribusiness and starvation, between 150 channels of television and ignorance. It is a subversive reality, that stagnant/stable economy that serves its people well, and in some ways it is a scary one. Kerala implies that there is a point where rich and poor might meet and share a decent life, and surely it offers new data for a critical question of our age: How much is enough?
