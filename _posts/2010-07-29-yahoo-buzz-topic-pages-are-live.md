  Topic pages are live in the <a href="http://buzz.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Buzz U.S. site</a>.  This is the project I&#8217;ve been working on for the last few months. The idea is to algorithmically generate topic pages for the buzzing topics of the day.  The popular topics can be accessed from the &#8220;top topics&#8221; nav bar in the Buzz site. For a sample, click <a href="http://topics.buzz.yahoo.com/topic/Chelsea_Clinton" target="_blank">here</a> to see the topic page about Chelsea Clinton.  A screenshot:

    <strong>Fun fact: </strong> We used these programming languages to build the back-end systems which power the site: Perl, PHP, Python, Java. Not to mention different storage and indexing systems, databases, servers, in-house and external frameworks, libraries etc.

    This is the hard-work of a lot of smart and dedicated people who I have the privilege to work with.  Please check it out and let me know what you think. Do you find it useful?  Did you run into any bugs?  Send me an email.  Keep watching this space for updates.  There is lot more to come, I promise.
